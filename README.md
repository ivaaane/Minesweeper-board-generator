ðŸ’£ Minesweeper board generator ðŸ’£  
=

This is a small repository for a Python code to generate a Minesweeper board. It can be used to make Minesweeper games or related projects.

This project was made as a practice for Python, so it's pretty small :p

Explanation
--
In Minesweeper, the board consists of a 2D tilemap of a number X number of *tiles*. These tiles are randomly replaced with bomb tiles.
Then, according to the bomb placement, number tiles are placed. The number of a tile represents the nÂº of bombs surrounding said tile.
If a tile shows "1", then there's one bomb in the 8 adjacent tiles; if it shows "2", there are two bombs, and so on...

Files
--
All the logic is contained in `board_generator.py`.

The file `style.py` stylizes the output to be more visually pleasing in the console. Here's an example output:  
```
1 2 3 * 1 1 1 2 * 3 3 3 * 2 * * 1             1 * 1     1 1
2 * * 2 1 2 * 3 2 * * * 2 2 2 2 2 1 1       1 2 2 1     1 *
